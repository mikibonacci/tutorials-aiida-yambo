    "# YamboWorkflow to easily compute several quasiparticle corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, several quasiparticle corrections (>100) needs to be computed: we may want to computed interpolated G0W0 bands (with `yambopy` or `wannier90`, for example), or we need it to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of G0W0 results, which represent the state-of-the-art protocol to compute optical properties of materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this task is a really time consuming: we need to split into several simulation, and the merge back the `ndb.QP` databases containing the quasiparticle corrections. \n",
    "Routinely, this can be done via simple scripts, for a small number of quasiparticle needed, within the `yambopy` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are dealing with demanding simulations, we can exploit the power of AiiDA to automatically obtain the merged quasiparticle database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The logic is simple: divide et impera. The workflow decides how to distribute the quasiparticle corrections among the calculations, following input parameters provided by the user. \n",
    "This represents the main difference with the standard `YamboWorklow` run. \n",
    "Then, under the hood, the plugin call `yambopy` to perform the final merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will proceed as the previous one, expect for the fact that, before the submission, we will provide the information needed to compute the wanted quasiparticles. "
