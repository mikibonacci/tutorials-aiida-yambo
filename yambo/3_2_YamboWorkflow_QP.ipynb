    "# YamboWorkflow to easily compute several quasiparticle corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, several quasiparticle corrections (>100) need to be computed: we may want to compute interpolated G0W0 bands (with `yambopy` or `wannier90`, for example), or we need them to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of G0W0 results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this task is really time consuming: we need to split into several simulations, and the merge back the `ndb.QP` databases containing the quasiparticle corrections. \n",
    "Routinely, this can be done via simple scripts,directly within the `yambopy` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are dealing with demanding simulations, we can exploit the power of AiiDA to automatically obtain the merged quasiparticles database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The logic is simple: divide et impera. The workflow decides how to distribute the quasiparticle corrections among the calculations, following input parameters provided by the user. \n",
    "This represents the main difference with the standard `YamboWorklow` run. \n",
    "Then, under the hood, the plugin call `yambopy` to perform the final merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will proceed as the previous one, expect for the fact that, before the submission, we will provide the information needed to compute the wanted quasiparticles. "
